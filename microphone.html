           <h4>INFO</h4> 
           <p>Combining a redesigned true condenser capsule, ultralow-noise transformerless circuitry, and an extremely durable housing, the Rode NT1-KIT large-diaphragm cardioid microphone is well suited for high-resolution digital recording of vocal and instrument sources at home, in the studio, or even on stage. Plus, its bundle of accessories—shockmount, pop filter, XLR cable, and dust cover—help the NT1-KIT serve singers, rappers, and podcasters especially well.While the body of the NT1 still resembles the NT1-A, the mic has been completely revamped except for the mesh grille. It features Rode's updated HF6 capsule, which is designed to provide a detailed midrange response with smooth highs and warm bass. The HF6 capsule is suspended inside the microphone using Rycote's industry-leading Lyre system to help reduce vibration and handling noises. Also, with self-noise measured at only 4.5 dBA, the NT1 is an exceedingly quiet microphone. Since it can run on 24 or 48 VDC phantom power, the NT1 can be used with a variety of professional and entry-level XLR mic preamps </p>

           <h4> Detailed Description</h4>
           <p>It has been developed with a focus on detailed midrange response, coupled with silky smooth high frequencies, and warm, round bass reproduction to make the NT1 an absolute standout in its class.</p>
           <p> The transducer itself is suspended inside the microphone using Rycote's industry-leading Lyre system, minimizing external vibrations at the capsule level. The capsule is then married to high-grade electronics that have been designed to provide an extremely low noise level. The NT1 is an incredibly quiet microphone, measuring only 4.5 dBA of self-noise.</p>
           <p>The NT1's body is machined from 6061 aluminum and then nickel plated for resistance against corrosion. Finally it is coated in a durable, military-grade ceramic layer, using advanced electrostatic application techniques developed by Rode to ensure an extremely hard wearing finish that is resistant to scratches or marks.</p>
           <p>The NT1 is supplied with the SM6, a high-quality suspension shockmount that provides isolation from external physical factors that may cause unwanted rumble and vibrations in the microphone. It includes a removable pop shield with two axes of adjustment and a telescopic arm for ultimate application versatility. The mic also comes with a balanced XLR microphone cable.</p>

           <h4>INFO</h4> 
           <p> Boasting components and design ported from their top-shelf models, the Lewitt LCT 440 PURE is a side-address true condenser microphone that offers a rewarding studio-class sound on anything from vocals and acoustic instruments to drums and guitar cabs. It features a gold-sputtered 1" large-diaphragm capsule and high-end circuitry, so it can produce polished sonics and handle punishing SPLs before distorting. Supplied with a shockmount, foam windscreen, and pop filter, the LCT 440 PURE is a capable mic package for the studio or stage.</p>
           <p>The mic's cardioid polar pattern is most sensitive to sound directly in front of it while rejecting a significant amount of ambient noise behind the capsule. The mic imparts a lift in the treble range to enhance crispness and clarity without sounding brittle. As with all solid-state true condensers, the LCT 440 PURE requires 48V phantom power and can be connected to an XLR input on your mixer, audio interface, or mic preamp.</p>

           <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
           <p> With its larger-than-life sound and outstanding build quality, the LCT 440 PURE is specifically designed to let you perform comfortably while sounding sensational. That is possible because the LCT 440 PURE uses the same high-end components, capsule, and circuit design as Lewitt's prestige models.</p>
           <p>Utilizing a one inch large-diaphragm true condenser capsule, the LCT 440 PURE delivers excellent performance specifications in dynamic range, high SPL handling, low noise, and high sensitivity, making it a studio allrounder that lives up to its name. Record acoustic guitars, drums, wind instruments, guitar cabinets, you name it. </p>

           <h4>INFO</h4> 
           <p> Presented in a green finish with a gold grille for an eye-catching vintage look, the MXL V67G condenser microphone is also designed to impart a classic sound that can be described as warm and mellow, making it an affordable solution for thickening vocals without EQ. With its Class-A FET circuitry and transformer-coupled output, it can provide sonic traits often associated with old tube mics. Since it is a solid-state condenser with an XLR output, it should be connected to a mic preamp that supplies standard 48V phantom power.</p>
           <p>The V67G is a side-address mic with a 1" gold-sputtered large diaphragm capable of capturing plenty of detail. Its somewhat wide cardioid polar pattern yields generous pickup at the front and sides of the mic while offering significant rejection of sound at the rear, which helps lessen the presence of room noise in home recordings. To further optimize the V67G for vocal sessions, accessories such as a foam windscreen, pop filter, and shockmount are available separately.</p>

           <p> 16 </p>
           <h4>Detailed Description</h4>
           <p>Designed mainly for vocals, the V67G combines Class-A FET circuitry and a transformer-coupled output resulting in a pure and warm sound that's akin to the mellow vibe of an old-school tube mic. Rather than opting for transparency, its frequency response features a thicker midrange that adds body to vocals.</p>
           <p> The V67G has a 1" gold-sputtered diaphragm and a fairly wide cardioid pickup pattern that is least sensitive to sound behind the mic. Large-capsule condensers such as the V67G are very sensitive, readily revealing subtle sonic details.</p>
           <p> Due to its balanced XLR output and solid-state condenser electronics, the V67G should be connected via an XLR mic cable (available separately) to the mic input of a device that can supply 48V phantom power.</p>
